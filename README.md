# Lean implementation and proofs of general binary search algorithm correctness
The general binary search algorithm described [here](https://julesjacobs.com/notes/binarysearch/binarysearch.pdf) by Jules Jacobs is more
flexible and is simpler to formally verify than the traditional presentation. Here, we implement and verify its correctness using the [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) 
programming language and theorem prover.
